        Sri Arutprakasa Ramalinga Vallalar opened a temple in Vadalur on January 25, 1872, called the Sathya Gnana Sabha.
        The temple hosts festivals and monthly puja dates, which attract thousands of visitors.
         The temple is octagonal in shape and has three sabhas, or halls:
         the Chirchabai which represents moon or left eye of people,
         the Porchabai  or golden sabha which represents the sun or right eye of people,
          the Gnana Sabai which represents the third eye or the wisdom of people.
         The sanctum sanctorum is hidden from the main hall by seven curtains, which are only parted on Thai Poosam day.
         The oven in the Dharma Sala that was lit by Sri Valallar in 1867 has never been extinguished and 153 years later, is still burning. 
         He initiated the Annadhanam, feeding the poor. This practice continues to this day.
